A simple mapbox-gl game for fun !

This is a simple game I developed as part of understanding React and Mapbox GL

As the pilot of the drone at the center of the map, you are tasked to survey some suspicious regions in the area on this map.

You only have the distances to those areas from where your drone is. Once you are near by 200m, the target will be visible

Find out those areas to successfully complete this challenge !

Use keyboard arrow Keys to fly the drone.

Feel free to open an issue or a PR!

Have some fun!
